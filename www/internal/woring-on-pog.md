# Guidelines for Working on the POG Projects

These are some ideas for our mode of working on the project. Nothing is set in stone: If something doesn't work out well, we need to learn and adapt.

- **Work independently**\
  We're not following a strict framework, but taking ideas from many agile frameworks like XP and Kanban.
  There's a global Kanban board which we use to track overall progress and work across all repos. Everyone can take and create new Issues/Tasks, however larger changes and ideas should be discussed with the team in ideation sessions, so work doesn't get thrown away.

- **Collective Code Ownership**\
  Anyone can improve or amend any code any Piece of code. That doesn't mean you can't feel responsible for a module or even whole project: for major changes it is important to be on the same page with the vision.

- **Commit and Integrate often**\
  No branch should exist longer than a day. Merge into our development branch as soon as possible to prevent conflicts.
  This development branch should be always _ready_, so new features should be either hidden behind feature flags, dark lauching or branching by abstraction.

- **Pull Requests**\
  If your confident in your changes and they are minor or cosmetic, or have been created through Pair-Programming, no review is required.

  Otherwise, you can ask anyone in the team for a short review or post it in the #blockers discord channel.

  These reviews shoudn't be too strict: Code Quality is important, however mostly stylistic or subjective qualities can be left as is and can at most be commented on.

- **Communicate**\
  If any issues or uncertainty crops up, be sure to communicate them with the rest of the team as fast as possible, either through asyncronous communication or by jumping in a discord channel. Try to join the discord channels regulary to ideate, peer-program, discuss or just hang out.

  For more formal ideas, create a github issue and ask the rest of the team for feedback.

- **Regular Ideation and Peer-Programming Sessions**\
  Only the need arises, we also have the possibility to have a short planning meeting.
