# What is `pog.network`?

We're a team of software engineers who take a critical look at the current ecosystem of crypto-nonsense and want to do something about it: no NFTs, no ICO, no Founder's bonus.
We want to build a fast, easy to use, and most importantly, not climate destroying base for the next generation of decentralized applications.

## Zero bullshit. Just cool tech.

# Protocol TLDR

We're creating a new Consensus Algorithm called `Delegated proof of Importance`, which aims to de-commercialize the governance of our protocol. This is combined with various next-generation technologies like using a Block-Lattice structure instead of a simple chain and WASM-based Smart Contracts.

# Our Current Status

`pog.network` is currently in a very early phase. Right now, we're working hard on formalizing our specification and finishing our first, fully-working working version.
