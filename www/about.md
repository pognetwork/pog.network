# What is `pog.network`?

We're a team of software engineers who are taking a critical look at the current ecosystem of crypto-nonsense and want to do something about it. No NFTs, no ICO, no Founder's bonus.
We want to build a fast, easy to using and most important of all not climate destroying base for the next generation of decentralized application.

## Zero bullshit. Just cool tech.

# Protocol TLDR

We're creating a new Consensus Algorithm called `Delegated proof of Importance`, which aims to de-commercialize the governance of our protocol. This is combined with various next-generation technologies like using a Block-Lattice structure instead of a simple chain and WASM-based Smart Contracts.

# Our Current Status

`pog.network` is currently in a very early phase. Currently, we're working hard on formalizing our specification and finding out what we want to actually build. Still, we want to begin building something as soon as we have the basics about right and experiment in software to figure out any problems that might come up.
