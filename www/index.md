# POG.network

## What is POG?

* We want to learn about Distributed-Ledger-Technology by creating our own currency from scratch
* The current generation of cryptos is harmful to the environment and want to use POG to create a net positive impact
* We want to create something minimalist and do one thing well
 
## What we are looking for

We are looking for anyone who is interested in building this together with us, however primarily Software Engineers. Experience with blockchains/cryptos is a plus, however not required. Preferably, please contact us as soon as possible since we already want to start refining our vision in the summer.
