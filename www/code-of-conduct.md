# POG Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The POG community pledges to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Rules

Our only real rule is: **Be excellent to each other**
Harassment of any kind isn't tolerated.

## Enforcement

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported anonymously at `contact@pog.network`.
Before submitting a report, we urge everyone to send SAI-Feedback to the relevant parties and solve issues professionally by talking them out.

> If someone made a joke which hurt you: talk about it first. Only then escalate to reporting it.

If you disagree with a decision, please message us at the same address, and we will discuss it again with the entire team.
We want to stay away from punishments as much as possible and talk everything out, but if the situation demands it, the team will take the necessary steps.
